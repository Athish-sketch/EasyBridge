# EasyBridge 🔗

EasyBridge is a beginner-friendly project idea to enable **offline file sharing** between Android and iOS using Wi-Fi or hotspot. It includes a simple **data science component** to track and analyze file sharing activity.

## 🌟 Project Highlights
- 📁 Offline file sharing (inspired by EasyShare and Snapdrop)
- 🔄 Android ↔ iOS ↔ Web
- 📊 Transfer data logging and basic analytics
- ✅ Beginner-friendly setup (no advanced coding required)

## 📊 Analytics Features
- Track file size, duration, method, and success
- Basic charts and summaries
- Predict transfer success (future work)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
EasyBridge/
├── datasets/
│   └── file_logs.csv          # Simulated transfer data
├── analytics/
│   └── transfer_analysis.ipynb  # Python notebook for analysis
```

## 🚀 How to Use
1. View or expand `file_logs.csv` to add your own test data.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in `analytics/` to see stats and graphs.
3. Upload it all to GitHub and showcase your idea!
